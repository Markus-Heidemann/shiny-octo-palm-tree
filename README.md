This repo is designed to allow you to easily learn to write better `C++` code. In the `task` directory are various various programming tasks that you may choose to solve. If you are interested in solving one of them please proceed as follows:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your own subdirectory in the task folder you want to solve
3. Create a pull request for this repository

For every pull request you will get:
* They are compiled with various compilers (currently `gcc` and `clang`).
* One of the compiler runs also includes output of `clang-tidy`.
* We run your unit tests and provide the code coverage.
* There are also two code quality linters enabled that may provide useful information.
In general you may to choose not to fix every compiler or linter warning, but you should try to understand the origin of these warnings.

**Note**: We will not merge every pull request that is sent to this repo. Feel free to close them, once you have finished a task.
